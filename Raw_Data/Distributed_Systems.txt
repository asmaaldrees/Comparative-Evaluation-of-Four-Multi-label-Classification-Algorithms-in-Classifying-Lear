Implementation of Agent Based Dynamic Distributed Service
The concept of distributed computing implies a network/internet-work of independent nodes which are logically configured in such a manner as to be seen as one machine by an application. Agents and multi-agent systems are useful in modeling complex distributed processes. They focus on support for, ...

Fault-tolerant Distributed Computer Systems
Distributed systems are difficult to build and understand, for all sorts of reasons. Failures are common in large systems, and we can't let them shut the application down; a well-engineered system will tolerate failures and repair any damage they caused. A single event, perceived at multiple ...
