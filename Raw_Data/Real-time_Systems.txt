Time to completion reveals problem-solving transfer
Two equally skilled groups of students taking introductory mechanics solve related physics problem pairs in reverse order with respect to each other, using the web-based Socratic tutor, MasteringPhysics. In tutorial problems containing help in the form of requestable hints, descriptive text, and ...

Impact of a Classroom Interaction System on Student Learning
We have developed and implemented a Web-based wireless classroom interaction system in a large-enrollment introductory physics lecture class that uses HP handheld computers (PDAs) to facilitate real-time two-way student interaction with the instructor. Our system is ahead of other “clicker” based ...
