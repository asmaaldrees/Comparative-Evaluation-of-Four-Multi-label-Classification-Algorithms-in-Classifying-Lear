Algorithm Design Techniques -- Programming Pearls
The problem arose in one-dimensional pattern recognition: The input is a vector X of N real numbers; the output is the maximum sum found in any contiguous subvector of the input. The problem is when some of the numbers are negative. This column is built around that problem with an emphasis on the ...

Before Programming : On Teaching Introductory Computing
In comparison with most other human intellectual activities, computing is in its infancy despite the progress we seem to have made in such a short time. Consequently, there has been insufficient time for the evolution of 'best ways' to transmit computing concepts and skills. It is therefore prudent ...
